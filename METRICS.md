# PhoneFold — METRICS

Every number here comes from an actual measurement. Estimates are never recorded.
**Simulator-derived figures are marked explicitly as such**: Simulator numbers are meaningless
for ANE work.

No measurements yet.

## Phase 0 — sample trajectory generation

Measured 2026-08-28 on the M1 Max, CPU (not MPS), torch 2.9.1, transformers 4.57.1,
`facebook/esmfold_v1`, fp32. Readouts at the end of each recycle, all 8 structure-module
IPA layers, 4 recycles: 32 frames per protein.

**These are generation-time figures on a Mac. They say nothing about on-device or ANE
performance**, which is measured in P0-10 and is a human-verifiable gate.

### Control: the patched trunk reproduces the unpatched model exactly

| Protein | max CA coordinate difference | max pLDDT difference |
|---|---|---|
| Ubiquitin | 0.000e+00 A | 0.000e+00 |
| GFP | 0.000e+00 A | 0.000e+00 |

### Generated trajectories

| Protein | aa | frames | final mean pLDDT | generation (s) | file (MB) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trp-cage TC5b | 20 | 32 | 91.1 | 2.7 | 0.0 |
| Villin HP36 | 36 | 32 | 92.1 | 3.5 | 0.1 |
| Pin1 WW domain | 34 | 32 | 92.5 | 3.6 | 0.1 |
| Protein G B1 | 56 | 32 | 88.3 | 5.4 | 0.1 |
| Alpha-3D | 73 | 32 | 78.9 | 7.6 | 0.1 |
| Ubiquitin | 76 | 32 | 90.5 | 7.6 | 0.1 |
| Proinsulin | 86 | 32 | 55.2 | 9.5 | 0.1 |
| Lysozyme | 129 | 32 | 95.1 | 20.5 | 0.2 |
| Alpha-synuclein | 140 | 32 | 33.3 | 24.8 | 0.2 |
| Myoglobin | 153 | 32 | 93.5 | 30.6 | 0.3 |
| GFP | 238 | 32 | 43.3 | 68.6 | 0.4 |
| Beta-2 AR 7TM | 314 | 32 | 85.6 | 127.9 | 0.5 |

Total bundle size 2.2 MB.

Two low scores are the model's own and are reproduced exactly by the unpatched model:
alpha-synuclein at 33.3 is correct behaviour for an intrinsically disordered protein and is
the intended teaching example; GFP at 43.3 is a genuine single-sequence failure on a
beta-barrel, not a defect in this pipeline.

# PhoneFold — BLOCKERS

Questions and decisions that require Marc. Each entry dated, with context, options considered,
and a recommendation. Nothing here is resolved by the agent.

## Noted, not blocking

### 2026-08-28 — Free disk space is 41 GB

Not a halt, but worth Marc knowing before Phase 0 task P0-05 runs.

The Phase 0 export work needs, roughly: PyTorch for Apple Silicon (~2.5 GB), the ESMFold
checkpoint (~5 GB, which includes ESM-2 650M), coremltools and its intermediates during
conversion (peaks around 2-3x model size), plus the exported `.mlpackage` artefacts and Xcode
DerivedData. That is comfortably 15-20 GB against 41 GB free.

It should fit. If it does not, the agent halts rather than deleting anything.
